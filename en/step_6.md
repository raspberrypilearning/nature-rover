## Create another sample

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Choose what the rover samples next! Do they see a new species of plant, bug or animal? Do they see some water or mysterious liquid? Do they want to sample some dirt or a rock? Or something else?

**Choose:** Add a new sample sprite for the rover to collect to your project, either by selecting one from the library or drawing your own.

--- /task ---

Get your sample sprite to scroll. If it is low down on the screen it should move more, and if it is high up on the screen it should move less.

--- task ---

Add code so that your sprite scrolls. 

--- /task ---

**Choose:** Depending on what you want the rover to sample next, you can either use the rover animations that are there already, or create more animation sequences by duplicating and editing the costumes.

--- task ---

Add a function to your rover sprite to animate the rover when it collects the new sample. You can copy and paste the code from one of the other functions.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create a new `broadcast message`{:class='block3events'} that will be used in the function, to cause a `costume`{:class='block3looks'} or `graphic effect`{:class='block3looks'} change in the sprite.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Use an `if`{:class='block3control'} block to detect if the rover is touching the sprite or touching a colour on the sprite, so that the new `function`{:class='block3myblocks'} is only called then.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

If you like, add an animation to the sprite, so that it's appearance changes when the rover has collected the sample.
