What script would you add to the rover to make it move up and down

--- choices ---

- ( ) 

```blocks3
when touching [up button v]
change y by (10)

when touching [down button v]
change y by (-10)

```

  This would move the rover when it is touching the buttons, rather than when the buttons are pressed.

- ( )

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
change y by (10)
```

--- feedback ---

  This would move the rover when it was clicked on, rather than when the buttons are clicked on.

- (x)

```blocks3
when I receive [up v]
change y by (10)

when I receive [down v]
change y by -10

``` 

  --- feedback ---

  Yes, this script receives the up and down broadcasts from the controller buttons and gets the rover to move up and down.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 

```blocks3
define up
change y by (10)

define down
change y by (-10)

```


  --- feedback ---

  This creates functions for moving up and down, but as the functions are not called, the rover would not move.
