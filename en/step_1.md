## Introduction

In this project, you will create a wilderness scene for a nature rover to explore.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Rovers**</span> are robots. They can be used to carry out science experiments in remote places, like Mars!  They examine their surroundings and they can be directed to interesting features and take samples. If they are solar powered, they can place themselves in sunny positions to recharge their batteries.
</p>

You will:
+ Move sprites with a touch friendly controller
+ Organise costume changes with `my blocks`{:class='block3custom'}
+ Create a realistic scene using scrolling


<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Scrolling**</span> is when graphics (or objects in your scene) move left, right, up or down on a computer screen. Scrolling makes scenes look more realistic.

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
What happens when you click the buttons to move the rover? How would you describe how the background/sprites scroll (move around)?

Try and collect a sample by moving the rover to one of the sprites and then clicking the rover.
