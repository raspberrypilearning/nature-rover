## Upgrade your project

Make your rover interact with the nature scene even more, similar to what a real rover might do. 

You can:
- add even more samples to your project, using the prebuilt animations or ones you create yourself.
- use variables to count samples, that increases each time a sample is collected.
- introduce an energy variable so that the rover has to use a renewable energy source like the sun, to recharge.
- animate the rover when it has collected enough samples (for example, it could do a dance and then fly away)

You can use any of the blocks that you learned about in this project, as well as those that you already know.

```blocks3
define collect sample ::custom
```

```blocks3
set [energy v] to (100)
```

```blocks3
change [energy v] by (-1)
```

```blocks3
if <touching color (#FFAA00) ?> then
```
